# Contributing to the Term Deposit Classification Project

This page outlines how to propose a change to the term deposit classification project.

## Fixing typos

Small typos or grammatical errors in documentation may be edited directly using the GitHub web interface, so long as the changes are made in the source file.

## Prerequisites

Before you make a substantial pull request, you should always file an issue and make sure someone from the team agrees that it's a problem.

## Report bugs

If you've found a bug, create an associated issue and illustrate the bug. Make sure you first check existing issues to determine if the bug has already been reported. If so, add your comment to that discussion instead of creating a separate issue.

Please be detailed in your reports. Include a concise, descriptive title, clear reproducible exxamples and a description of the expected vs observed behaviour of your bug.

## Contributing Code and Pull request guidlines

We recommend that you create a Git branch for each pull request (PR).
New code should follow the PEP8 style guide.

In all pull requests, please include a link to the filed issue describing the problem you are attempting to fix, and a thorough description of the change. Please make the description as clear as possible so that the reviewer can easily understand your changes.
